List of things to be done
-------------------------

 - Add auto-reconnection so when the server drops us, we can connect
   without needing any input.  Almost had this today, but had to go to
   work, and it still wasn't working, so i ditched it.

 - Allow receiving of user input.  I believe toc-get-info returns the
   URL of the user's information.  Perhaps this could be retrieved and
   displayed in a buffer.

 - Improve interface for editing buddy list.
