List of things to be done
-------------------------

 - Allow receiving of user info.  I believe toc-get-info returns the
   URL of the user's information.  Perhaps this could be retrieved and
   displayed in a buffer.

 - Improve interface for editing buddy list.

 - Allow logging of all IM conversations.

 - Add chat rooms to be listed in the buddy buffer, as well as IM
   messages from non-buddies, and offline buddies.
