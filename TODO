List of things to be done
-------------------------

 - Allow receiving of user info.  I believe toc-get-info returns the
   URL of the user's information.  Perhaps this could be retrieved and
   displayed in a buffer.

 - Improve interface for editing buddy list.

 - Allow logging of all IM conversations.
