List of things to be done
-------------------------

 - Allow receiving of user input.  I believe toc-get-info returns the
   URL of the user's information.  Perhaps this could be retrieved and
   displayed in a buffer.

 - Improve interface for editing buddy list.

 - Display in buddy list which buddies currently have events waiting
   in the event ring.

 - Allow some way of specifying beep-on-buddy-sign-onoff on a
   per-buddy and/or per-group basis.

 - Allow logging of all IM conversations.
