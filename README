What is TNT?
------------
TNT is an Emacs client for AIM, AOL's free instant messaging service.
Using TNT, you can, from the comfort of your Emacs window, check whether
friends and coworkers are online, send them "instant messages", and
join them in multi-party private chat sessions.  Unlike the official
AIM clients, TNT is designed to be functional rather than pretty, easy
to use rather than easy to learn.  It doesn't have a graphical user
interface, fancy artwork, or other random fluff.  Instead, like other
emacs extensions, it has a keyboard-driven, text-based interface.  TNT
is AIM for grownups ;-).


Is there support for TNT?
-------------------------
TNT is currently housed at sourceforge.net, and is headed by the project
members there.  To join the mailing list for this project, please go to

What versions of Emacs are supported?
-------------------------------------
TNT was developed using GNU Emacs 19.34.  We've briefly tested it with
versions 19.29, 19.30, 20.2, and 20.3, and it seems to work.  It also
seems to work with XEmacs 20.4.

If you are using a version of GNU Emacs earlier than 19.29, you will not
be able to load the compiled (.elc) files because those versions used a
different byte-code format.  You may, however, be able to run successfully
if you delete (or recompile) the .elc files.

Version 18 of GNU Emacs is not supported.

What does TNT stand for?
------------------------
TNT was so named in order to differentiate it from TiK.  What then, you
may ask, is TiK?  TiK is another unoffical AIM client that is written
in Tcl.  Both TNT and TiK use a simplified protocol called TOC to
communicate with the AIM host.  (Actually, they communicate with a TOC
server which, in turn, communicates with the AIM host).  Details of the
TOC protocol are given in the file PROTOCOL, which is included in this
directory.  Info on TiK can be found at http://www.aim.aol.com/tik.


How do I get an account?
------------------------
Before you can use TNT, you need to have an AIM account.  The account is
free, and registering for it is only slightly painful :-).  Just go to
the AIM home page, http://www.aol.com/aim, and click on one of "sign up"
buttons there.  This will take you to a registration page where you can
enter your desired username (or "screen name" in AOL-speak) and password.
You also need to enter your e-mail address in order to receive the
confirmation e-mail that will allow you to permanently activate your
account.

The hardest part about registering is choosing a screen name.  There are
currently more than 30 million screen names in use, so don't expect the
first one you try to work.  Many people give up, believing that the
registration page is busted, after trying only their first and/or last
names.  Doh!  Unless you have an unusual name, this isn't going to work.
You need to be creative.

+------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------+

tnt-open (C-x t o)
  This command signs onto the AIM service.  You need to supply your
  screen name and password in response to the prompts in the minibuffer.
  If all goes well, you will get a "Signed on" message in the echo area,
  and an online indicator consisting of your screen name enclosed in
  brackets will appear in the mode line.  If something goes wrong,
  you'll probably just get a message like "TNT connection lost" in the
  echo area.

  If you don't want to enter your screen name and password every time,
  you can set the variables tnt-default-username and tnt-default-password
  in your init (.emacs) file.  If both of these variables are set, tnt-open
  will sign on immediately without prompting.  However, if other people
  have read permission for your init file, you may want to set only the
  username and continue to enter your password manually.

tnt-kill (C-x t k)
  This command signs off of the AIM service (or "kills" the TNT session).
  You'll get a "Signed off" message in the echo area, and the mode line
  will no longer show the online indicator.

tnt-im (C-x t i)
  This command initiates an "instant message" conversation with another
  user.  You will be prompted for the user's screen name.  If the user
  is on your buddy list, you can use the Emacs "completion" feature to
  assist you.  Hitting the tab key after typing one or more characters
  will cause Emacs to fill in as much of the rest of the name as it can.

  After you enter the screen name, the selected window will switch to a
  buffer in which the conversation will take place.  To send a message to
  the other user, simply type the message at the end of buffer.  The
  message will auto-wrap as you type and will be sent when you hit RETURN
  (or ENTER).  You can tell that the message has been sent because it
  will be prefixed with your screen name.

  When the person with whom you're conversing responds, his message,
  prefixed by his screen name, will be inserted in the buffer immediately
  after your sent message.  If you had already starting typing a new
  message when the response arrives, the response will be inserted before
  the new message so as not to disrupt your typing.

  When you are through with the conversation, you can simply kill or
  hide the buffer.  You can carry on multiple conversations at once.
  Each conversation goes into its own buffer.  The buffers have names
  of the form *im-name*, where "name" is the normalized screen name of
  the user you're conversing with.  (Normalized simply means that all
  spaces have been removed from the screen name and that the screen name
  has been smashed to lowercase).

  If the conversation buffer for a particular user isn't visible at the
  time a message from that user arrives, you'll get a notification in
  the echo area informing you that a new message is available.  You can
  use the tnt-accept or tnt-reject commands (described below) to either
  view or discard the message.

tnt-join-chat (C-x t j)
  This command joins a chat room in which you can converse with several
  users at once.  You will be prompted for the name of the room.  The
  default is a randomly-generated name of an empty chat room.  In most
  cases you will just want to use this name and invite other users into
  the room once you've joined.  However, if you know the name of an
  existing room, you may enter that instead.

  Once inside a chat room, you can invite other users to join.  You do
  this by typing an invitation message (describing the topic being
  discussed in the room) and terminating it with TAB (C-i).  You will be
  prompted for a list of users to invite.  Enter their screen names,
  separated by commas.  Each invited user will recieve a copy of the
  invitation message and will be given an opportunity to join the room.
  You will be informed as they join by status messages that appear in
  the room's buffer.

  To send a message to all users in a room, simply type the message and
  hit RETURN.  To send a private message to a particular user, terminate
  the message with LINEFEED instead of RETURN.  (You will be prompted
  for the screen name of the desired recipient).

tnt-accept (C-x t a)
  This command accepts a new message or chat invitation from another user.
  Use it when you recieve a notification in the echo area.  It will switch
  the selected window to either the conversation buffer or the chat buffer,
  as appropriate, and remove the notification.  If there was more than one
  pending notification, the next one will pop up in its place.  When you've
  dealt with all of them, the echo area will return to its normal (blank)
  state.

tnt-reject (C-x t r)
  This command rejects a new message or chat invitation from another user.
  Like tnt-accept, it is used when a notification appears in the echo area.
  Rather than switch to the conversation or chat buffer, though, it kills
  it.

tnt-next-event (C-x t n)
tnt-prev-event (C-x t p)
  Message and chat notifications are kept in a ring.  These commands allow
  you to step through the ring and view pending notifications without having
  to accept or reject them.  When you get to a notification that you want to
  act on, you can use tnt-accept or tnt-reject at that point.

tnt-show-buddies (C-x t b)
  This command switches the selected window to the *buddies* buffer.  This
  buffer is constantly updated while you are online to show the status of
  your "buddies".  Buddies are other users of either the AIM service or the
  primary AOL service.  You designate which users are your buddies by 
  creating a "buddy list" using the tnt-edit-buddies command described
  below.  If you do not have a buddy list, a default buddy list consisting of
  only you is used.

  While viewing the buddy list, you can use the "n" and "p" keys to move
  the cursor to the next or previous buddy name.  With the cursor positioned
  on a buddy name, you can use the "i" key to initiate an conversation
  with that buddy.

tnt-edit-buddies (C-x t B)
  This command allows you to edit your buddy list.  It switches the selected
  window to the *edit-buddies* buffer, which shows your entire buddy list
  (both online and offline users), and allows you to edit the list.  In the
  current release of TNT, the buddy-list editor is rather rudimentary.  You
  just edit the buffer in text mode and use the tnt-save-buddy-list command
  (C-x C-s) to save your changes.  Because the buddy list is stored on the
  host, you must be online in order to edit it.

  The buddy list is organized as a two-level hierarchy.  At the top level
  are group names (e.g. "Friends", "Coworkers", etc.), and at the second
  level are the screen names of the users in each group.  In the buddy
  editor, the buddy list is formatted so that the group names begin at
  the left margin.  Following each group name is a list of screen names
  of users in that group, one screen name per line.  In order to distinguish
  them from group names, the screen names are indented.  When editing
  the buddy list, you must be careful to maintain this format.

tnt-away-toggle (C-x t A)
  This function allows you to change your "away" mode.  When you are set as
  away, your away message will be sent to anyone who Instant Messenges you.
  When your away message is sent, a reminder notification is displayed
  in the minibuffer, and the away message is shown as a sent im.  The message
  will not be sent to a buddy, if that person was the last person to receive 
  your away message (Two people talking to you at once will make it bounce
  back and forth rather annoyingly).  This behaves identical to the away 
  meesages in most AIM clients.

tnt-pounce-add (C-x t P)
  This is a pounce package, very similar to the pounce packages for the 
  other available toc clients.  When invoked, it will prompt for a name
  of a buddy.  If the name entered does not appear in your buddy list
  this will not work.  When that buddy a.) Logs on, or b.) Changes their 
  their status either to or from away, they will be sent this message.  
  This can be useful for "leaving" messages for your buddies.

tnt-pounce-del (C-x t D)
  This is the function you can use to delete a pounce message for a buddy.
