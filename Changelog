March 31, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
------------------------------
 - Bugfix to fix the "no process" mesasges, due to incorrect calls
   in tnt-buddy-shutdown
 - Removed executable permissions on CVS for PROTOCOL and README

March 31, 2000 - John Jannotti
------------------------------
 - Made tnt-away and tnt-away-alist use t/nil instead of 1/0.  This
   simplifies a lot of code that uses them.
 - Fixed toc-set-away so that tnt.el doesn't need to call tocstr-send
   directly anymore.
 - toc-{add,remove}-buddy - change names, simplify interface
 - funcall (switch-buffer-function), not apply
 - use tocstr-send-flap, not tocstr-send-flap1 in tnt-keepalive
 - Simplified, sped up and docstringed tnt-rotate-{left,right}
 - Used emacs primitives instead of complicated code to simplify
   toc-encode, toc-normalize, tnt-strip-html, tnt-strip-a-href, and
   tnt-completing-read-list
 - Added tnt-separator variable
 - Rename send-away-msg to tnt-send-away-msg
 - Used identity in call to mapcar for tnt-show-chat-participants and
   tnt-handle-chat-update-buddy
 - Since 'message' takes the same format string as 'format' does, removed
   the need for a call to format in tnt-set-buddy-status, tnt-pounce-add,
   and tnt-switch-user
 - In tnt-participant-collection's call to mapcar, just use 'list
 - Simplify tnt-buddy-status, tnt-buddy-idle, tnt-buddy-away using the
   elisp idiom of not checking to see if a pair is nil or not before
   calling cdr. (You'll get nil either way)
 - Eliminated unused old-idle and old-away bindings in tnt-set-buddy-status.

March 30, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
------------------------------
 - added a user-defined variable to avoid needing to hack the code 
   if your mail executable isn't in /bin/mail.  tnt-email-binary.
 - fixed tnt-shutdown so it properly disposes of client-side away
   messages.
 - piping IMs to an email now prints a reminder message.  It may be
   beneficial to add a modeline change, but I don't have time today :P

March 29, 2000 - Neil "Fred" Picciotto
-------------------------------------
 - made piping to email simpler to configure (i.e. just set some
   variables, rather than having to go in and change the code)
 - made pounce-add tab-complete based on all buddies, rather than just
   those that are currently online
 - made pounce-del tab-complete based on pounce-list, rather than
   online buddies
 - moved a few bits of code around within the file (defvars of user-
   configurable variables all together at top, tnt-switch-user near
   tnt-open, and so on)
 - you can now hit C-g (or just return with no password) to get out of
   the password prompt
 - added config var for beeping when buddies sign on and off
 - fixed miscellaneous typos, etc
 - added explanations in INSTALL for all the user-configurable
   variables

March 27, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
------------------------------
 - Made keepalive an option to avoid conflicts with Xemacs
   enable with (setq tnt-use-keepalive t).

March 28, 2000 - Scott Evans
----------------------------
 - Made the recentering of the buffer optional.. it defaults to
   the current behavior.
 - Buddy entrances/exits are now displayed in the minibuffer
 - Code patch to change color of incoming user text when in a color
   environment.
 - Added a default away message, and a history.
 - Fixed the regexp for the tnt-im-buddy procedure

March 24, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
------------------------------
 - Keepalive packets are now sent to the server, improving uptime.
 - Fixed sending of nil messages, which would crash other clients 
   (older versions of Everbuddy, etc)
 - Pounce Package
 - Better away status checking
 - Numerous other minor bugfixes

March 24, 2000 - Scott Evans
----------------------------
 - Code patch to remove nil entries in the auto-completion list for screennames
 - fix in tnt-get-input-message which was killing the region, instead of 
   deleting in, which hosed the kill ring.

March 24, 2000 - Allan Poindexter
---------------------------------
 - Code snippet to show away status in modeline.

March 24, 2000 - Neil Picciotto
-------------------------------
 - Added a binding to the tnt-show-help command (C-x t ?)
 - Links are now displayed rather than being stripped.
 - Timestamps package has been added.
 - Beeping only happens when you are not in the im buffer of the person
   who is iming you.
 - Buddy list automagically comes up when you signon.  Also, if the option
   is set, (see INSTALL) the screen splits when the buddy list is displayed.
 - Return does the same as i in the buddy list, namely initiating an IM.
 - Mouse clicking a screenname now initiates an IM.
 - You can now cycle through a list of screennames to sign on as. 
 - Option (involving code change) that allows you to have all your IM's piped
   to a commandline.
