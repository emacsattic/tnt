April 4, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
-----------------------------
 - Added Makefile and .cvsignore
   Useful targets are "elc" to bytecompile all files and "release" to
   build a tar file of a release.

April 4, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
-----------------------------
 - Due to a non-completed commit, the .elc files were not added, and the
   permissions (which won't get changes) didn't change.  I just want to make
   a note that two changes (those with *'s) didn't actually happen on the 
   last update.

April 4, 2000 - Neil "Fred" Picciotto
-------------------------------------
- synchronized help info between the text block displayed by "C-x t ?"
  and that in the README.
- added to the README explanations of tnt-show-help, tnt-switch-user,
  and tnt-toggle-email.
- if *tnt-help* buffer already exists, tnt-show-help now switches to it
- removed line in INSTALL which said that it had only been tested in
  emacs 19.34, replaced it with line from README about the versions
  it's been tested in.
- *attempting once again to make PROTOCOL and README not be executable
  (cvs update for me left them non-executable, but cvs checkout, which
  creates new copies of everything, still gave me them as executable).
- *also making all the files non-writable, so that you have to explicitly
  chmod files before editing them.
- *checking in .elc files.  (was there some reason they were not being
  included?)  the .elc files are left writable so that when you
  compile, you don't have to first chmod or rm the .elc.

April 3, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
-----------------------------
 - tnt-show-timestamps has been renamed to tnt-use-timestamps to go with our
   naming conventions
 - added a mail-pipe in tnt-handle-closed to notify you that your connection
   has been closed (by the server, or by remote signon).

April 1, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
-----------------------------
 - Small change in tnt-get-away-msg to fix a possible error with trying
   to send a nil away message.  

April 1, 2000 - Neil "Fred" Picciotto
-------------------------------------
 - removed tnt-default-username-list variable, replaced it with
   a new tnt-username-alist variable, which assocs usernames with
   passwords.
 - explained the above in INSTALL.
 - tnt-pounce-delete was using "remassoc" which didn't compile for me;
   perhaps this was another XEmacs-ism?  in any case, wrote
   tnt-remassoc to remove an assoc from an alist.
 - removed some tab characters that were still lying around in tnt.el.

March 31, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
------------------------------
 - Bugfix to fix the "no process" mesasges, due to incorrect calls
   in tnt-buddy-shutdown
 - Removed executable permissions on CVS for PROTOCOL and README
 - Broke alot of fixed code in order to keep the project compatable
   with GNU emacs.  (replace-in-string) is not standard, and therefore
   breaks all over the place with GNU.  This affects: 
   - tnt-strip-a-href and tnt-strip-html in tnt.el and
   - toc-encode and toc-normalize
   These have been reverted to their orginal versions.
 - There was a problem with the changes to tnt-away, etc where (away) is not
   being appended to the buddy list for any away buddies.  This has been fixed.
   the problem was due to away being ignored in tnt-set-buddy-status

March 31, 2000 - John Jannotti
------------------------------
 - Simplified pounce deletion to just one function, picked
   tnt-pounce-delete as the "survivor". (Note this is user visable,
   but barely)
 - Simplified a lot of code by adding tnt-addassoc and using it.
 - renamed tnt-pounce-list to tnt-pounce-alist for consistency
 - Made tnt-away and tnt-away-alist use t/nil instead of 1/0.  This
   simplifies a lot of code that uses them.
 - Fixed toc-set-away so that tnt.el doesn't need to call tocstr-send
   directly anymore.
 - toc-{add,remove}-buddy - change names, simplify interface
 - funcall (switch-buffer-function), not apply
 - use tocstr-send-flap, not tocstr-send-flap1 in tnt-keepalive
 - Simplified, sped up and docstringed tnt-rotate-{left,right}
 - Used emacs primitives instead of complicated code to simplify
   toc-encode, toc-normalize, tnt-strip-html, tnt-strip-a-href, and
   tnt-completing-read-list
 - Added tnt-separator variable
 - Rename send-away-msg to tnt-send-away-msg
 - Used identity in call to mapcar for tnt-show-chat-participants and
   tnt-handle-chat-update-buddy
 - Since 'message' takes the same format string as 'format' does, removed
   the need for a call to format in tnt-set-buddy-status, tnt-pounce-add,
   and tnt-switch-user
 - In tnt-participant-collection's call to mapcar, just use 'list
 - Simplify tnt-buddy-status, tnt-buddy-idle, tnt-buddy-away using the
   elisp idiom of not checking to see if a pair is nil or not before
   calling cdr. (You'll get nil either way)
 - Eliminated unused old-idle and old-away bindings in tnt-set-buddy-status.

March 30, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
------------------------------
 - added a user-defined variable to avoid needing to hack the code 
   if your mail executable isn't in /bin/mail.  tnt-email-binary.
 - fixed tnt-shutdown so it properly disposes of client-side away
   messages.
 - piping IMs to an email now prints a reminder message.  It may be
   beneficial to add a modeline change, but I don't have time today :P

March 29, 2000 - Neil "Fred" Picciotto
-------------------------------------
 - made piping to email simpler to configure (i.e. just set some
   variables, rather than having to go in and change the code)
 - made pounce-add tab-complete based on all buddies, rather than just
   those that are currently online
 - made pounce-del tab-complete based on pounce-list, rather than
   online buddies
 - moved a few bits of code around within the file (defvars of user-
   configurable variables all together at top, tnt-switch-user near
   tnt-open, and so on)
 - you can now hit C-g (or just return with no password) to get out of
   the password prompt
 - added config var for beeping when buddies sign on and off
 - fixed miscellaneous typos, etc
 - added explanations in INSTALL for all the user-configurable
   variables

March 27, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
------------------------------
 - Made keepalive an option to avoid conflicts with Xemacs
   enable with (setq tnt-use-keepalive t).

March 28, 2000 - Scott Evans
----------------------------
 - Made the recentering of the buffer optional.. it defaults to
   the current behavior.
 - Buddy entrances/exits are now displayed in the minibuffer
 - Code patch to change color of incoming user text when in a color
   environment.
 - Added a default away message, and a history.
 - Fixed the regexp for the tnt-im-buddy procedure

March 24, 2000 - Jim Whitehead
------------------------------
 - Keepalive packets are now sent to the server, improving uptime.
 - Fixed sending of nil messages, which would crash other clients 
   (older versions of Everbuddy, etc)
 - Pounce Package
 - Better away status checking
 - Numerous other minor bugfixes

March 24, 2000 - Scott Evans
----------------------------
 - Code patch to remove nil entries in the auto-completion list for screennames
 - fix in tnt-get-input-message which was killing the region, instead of 
   deleting in, which hosed the kill ring.

March 24, 2000 - Allan Poindexter
---------------------------------
 - Code snippet to show away status in modeline.

March 24, 2000 - Neil Picciotto
-------------------------------
 - Added a binding to the tnt-show-help command (C-x t ?)
 - Links are now displayed rather than being stripped.
 - Timestamps package has been added.
 - Beeping only happens when you are not in the im buffer of the person
   who is iming you.
 - Buddy list automagically comes up when you signon.  Also, if the option
   is set, (see INSTALL) the screen splits when the buddy list is displayed.
 - Return does the same as i in the buddy list, namely initiating an IM.
 - Mouse clicking a screenname now initiates an IM.
 - You can now cycle through a list of screennames to sign on as. 
 - Option (involving code change) that allows you to have all your IM's piped
   to a commandline.
