How do I install TNT?
---------------------
To install TNT, you must perform two steps.  First, you must ensure
that the TNT Lisp files are in a directory that is on your load path;
second, you must arrange for these files to be loaded into Emacs.
There are several ways of accomplishing each step.  The method you
choose will depend on how your computer is set up and on your personal
preferences.  Rather than attempt to describe all possibilities, I'll
just describe one simple, albeit non-optimal, method.  If you are
experienced with Emacs, you'll undoubtedly want to improve on it.

Both steps can be accomplished by adding two lines to your Emacs init
file.  This file is typically called ".emacs" and usually resides in your
home directory.  Edit this file and add the following two lines to the
end, substituting the absolute path of the directory containing this
README file for the "..." in the first line.  

        (setq load-path (cons ".../lisp" load-path))
        (load "tnt")

Once you've done this, exit and restart Emacs to force the change to
take effect.  If you see an error message in the echo area at the bottom
of the Emacs window, you may have mistyped one of the lines.  If there's
no error, you're probably all set.  To test whether TNT was loaded, use
the describe-function command (invoked by C-h f) to describe the function
tnt-open.  If it works, you should be able to run TNT.

(Note: TNT has currently only been tested with Emacs version 19.34.  How
well it works with earlier or later versions is not known).

INSTALLATION OPTIONS
--------------------

The following options can also be included in your .emacs file, to invoke
some certain non-default options:

(setq tnt-use-timestamps t)  
 	This will add a timestamp for each message you receive or send.
	This is best for logging, and for people who are on very often.

(setq tnt-use-split-buddy t)
	This will force tnt to split to window horizontally whenever the
	buddy list command is invoked.  This rule does not apply when in 
	in the scratch buffer.

(setq tnt-use-keepalive t)
	This tells TNT to use the keepalive packets to help keep your
	connection alive.  Try this is you keep getting booted randomly

(setq tnt-recenter-windows nil)
	This tells TNT to NOT recenter each window automatically.
